- App Purpose: At the top of the screen, display the title "AI Detection".

- Percentage Circle: In the center of the screen, there is a circular progress bar to display the percentage of sound detection progress. Initially, it is set to 0% or an empty circuit. The circle can be gradually filled in as the detection process progresses.

- Start discovery button: Below the percentage circle, a button with the text “check” Users will click this button to start the sound detection process, currently, it only produces random percentages until it is developed later.

- Download Audio button: It is a button with text "up" that enables you to access audio clips on your device.

- Audio clip field: Next to the "up" button, there should be an empty text field ( or uploaded file) at the beginning, where the name of the audio clip selected by the user will appear.

Note: the application was run in a simulator in Xcode, so there is no audio upload to the application, but the application works well as shown in the video, and does what we want from it.
